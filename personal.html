        <h3><u>Interest In Design</u></h3>
        <p>I was first interested in Graphic Design thanks to my high school deisgn teacher, who also went to Millersville University. I took three years of his classes and was introduced to the Adobe Suite and software like Photoshop and Illustrator. I took a strong liking to photo manipulation, but as I have grown as a designer I now enjoy vector graphics and Illustrator just as much.</p>

        <h3><u>Inspiration</u></h3>
        <p>I take a lot of my inspiration from modern designs, I like minimal and sleek looks as opposed to a lot of color or abstract deisgns that I see on city streets designed to catch peopleâ€™s eye.</p>
